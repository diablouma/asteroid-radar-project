# Purpose of this Folder

This folder should contain the scaffolded project files to get a student started on their project. This repo will be added to the Classroom for students to use, so please do not have any solutions in this folder.

## Note: Android Kotlin Gradle Update
Use the updated Gradle version in the `~/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file:
```
distributionUrl = https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.1.1-all.zip
```

#PROVIDING API KEY TO THE APP
Please create a file called ```apikey.properties``` in the root folder and add a key-value pair like:
```NASA_API_KEY="anAPIKeyForNasaRestServices"```

Note: The double quotes are required, and this value will be used by the app to connect to the service.
